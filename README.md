## Description 
This application serves as a portfolio site for a photographer. It includes an "About Me" section, a contact form, and 4 different categories of images that the user can select from. 

This is the first application I build using React, and served as an introduction to state, the virtual DOM, and single page applications. The images that are rendered depend on the state of the category list in the nav bar. 

## Dependancies 
Photo Port is dependant on the following npm packages: 
* react v17.0.2
